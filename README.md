# Get genome fasta files from a tsv file generated by BLAST

This is a way to get genome data by genome id from a tsv file generated by BLAST. The tsv file contains information of the species id and the genomen hit ids. One example is provided in the repo. `sh` scripting is used to automate the downloading processes facilitated by the two tools `datasets` and `dataformat` from NCBI. 

## Instal `datasets` and `dataformat` from NCBI

Follow the [link](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/docs/v2/download-and-install/) to install these two tools. 

## Run `getgenome.sh`

Basically, what this script does is:

1. Extract the species label, e.g. c497da3b39f30aceede6bec3b03cd100 and the genome id, e.g. GB_GCA_905618805.1 from each line in the tsv file. One species label may have several genome ids, also called hits;

2. Generate folders for species and the corresponding hits;

3. Run `datasets` to download the genome data package. Make sure `datasets` is in the same folder as the `sh` script. 

```
sh getgenome.sh
```

The package contains a bunch to information. See [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/docs/v2/reference-docs/data-packages/genome/) for details. A fasta file is included in the package;

4. Unzip the downloaded data. 

## Caveats

1. Only tested on MacOS;

2. This is just a sequencial process script. So, it may be super slow if you want to download a large set of genomes;

3. This downloading may request a large space to store the data. 

## To do list

1. Parallelize the downloading processes.
